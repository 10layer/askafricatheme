AskAfrica Theme
===============

This is the AskAfrica theme package for Alaveteli.

To install::

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/10layer/askafricatheme.git

Look in the lib/ folder of the plugin to see how the overrides happen.

Note that the `install.rb` plugin point sets up a symlink to include
local resource files within the Rails `public/` directory.
